# BojayBSite-DEPRICATED.     GO TO [Bojay.be](https://github.com/BojayB/Bojay.be)

Bojay.be is my new and improved website. Go there to see what I'm currently working on.

If BojayBSite is what you prefer, go to [bojab.neocities](https://bojab.neocities.org) (page "meg" is not on neocities, I have no clue why).


Just the website that I've made. Take whatever you want from it.

The css can be found at https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura/blob/master/css/sakura-vader.css. 

Copy the raw data from their css, make a file called ```sakura-vader.css```, paste the raw data you've copied into it, and save it in the root of the web files.
